# 🌌 Project ECHO: Design & Economy Whitepaper

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project ECHO** is a high-fidelity, first-person survival simulation set in a "Post-Apocalyptic Futuristic" timeline. Players explore the "Exclusion Zone"—a beautiful, overgrown ruin of advanced technology—to scavenge resources, build bases, and survive against the environment and other players.

The game utilizes a **Dual-Token Economy** on Solana to ensure sustainability, profitability for the platform, and deep player retention through "hidden staking" mechanics.

## 2. Lore & World: "The Fall"

### The Backstory

Decades ago, a catastrophic orbital war—known as **"The Fall"**—shattered civilization. Massive fleets from unknown origins (or perhaps our own future?) clashed above the Earth. The debris rained down for months, leveling cities and poisoning the atmosphere. When the skies finally cleared, the survivors emerged from Vaults and bunkers to find a changed world: beautiful, overgrown, and littered with alien technology.

No one knows who won the war. No one knows if anyone is still up there. But the wrecks that fell... they hold secrets worth dying for.

### Crashed Ship Types (Scavenge Points)

The battlefield debris falls into two categories: **Terran (Human)** and **Unknown (Alien/Future Tech)**.

#### Terran Wrecks (Familiar, Repairable)

| Ship Type | Description | Loot / Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fighter Cockpit** | Single-seat attack craft. Often found in clusters after dogfights. | Pilot gear, emergency rations, small arms ammo. Sometimes a salvageable Fusion Cell. |
| **Bomber Fuselage** | Heavy attack craft. Larger, more dangerous to explore (unstable munitions). | Explosive components, heavy weapon parts, rare "Ordnance Cores." |
| **Corvette Wreck** | Small patrol ship. Half-buried in fields or smashed into buildings. | Scrap Metal, Basic Circuits, damaged weapons. Quick in-and-out. |
| **Battleship Section** | Massive. Only fragments survived re-entry. Forms multi-story structures. | Vehicle Bay access, Command Bridge loot (lore/data), heavy armor plating. |

#### Unknown Wrecks (Alien/Future Tech)

| Ship Type | Description | Loot / Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drone Swarm Hive** | Organic-looking spherical pods. Still dangerous—dormant drones may reactivate. | "Living Metal" (self-repairing material), Swarm Cores (AI components). |
| **Interceptor Shard** | Sleek, angular fighters. Crashed at high speed, creating deep craters. | Phaseweave Alloy (ultra-light armor), Lens Arrays (advanced optics for scopes). |
| **Frigate Hull** | Medium cruiser. Partially intact, creating a dungeon-like interior. | Power Cells, Weapon Mods, Data Drives (encrypted alien lore). Guarded by rogue security drones. |
| **Carrier Skeleton** | City-sized wreck. Multiple floors, hangars, crew quarters. | AI Cores (rare NFTs), Blueprint Fragments, Gravity Drives. **Major PvP Zone.** |
| **Escape Pods** | Tiny, scattered randomly. Often overlooked. | Chance for unique cosmetics, small token caches, or cryptic messages. |
| **Orbital Station Debris** | Chunks of a destroyed space station embedded in the ground. | Preserved research data. Unlocks advanced crafting "Recipes." |

### The Reconstruction System (Vehicle Rebuilding)

Players can find **Blueprint Fragments** inside larger wrecks. Collecting a full set allows them to **Reconstruct** a functional vehicle or mech in their Vault's Workshop.

| Reconstruction Project | Blueprint Fragments Needed | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terran Scout Buggy** | 3 (Common) | A fast, lightly armored ground vehicle. Great for traversal. |
| **Terran Walker Mech** | 5 (Rare) | A slow, heavily armored bipedal mech. Mounted weapons. |
| **Unknown Hoverbike** | 4 (Uncommon) | A sleek anti-gravity bike. Silent and fast. Requires Phaseweave upkeep. |
| **Unknown Interceptor** | 8 (Legendary) | A rebuilt alien fighter. Allows brief aerial travel. Extremely rare and expensive to maintain. |

*Reconstruction requires significant token investment for parts and power, acting as a major token sink.*

### Scavengeable Upgrades (Examples)

* **Kinetic Shielding:** A personal energy shield that absorbs one hit. Requires a rare "Capacitor" from Frigate wrecks.
* **Gravity Boots:** Allows short boosts or wall-clings. Found in Carrier hangars.
* **Targeting Implant:** HUD overlay showing enemy weak points. Requires an "AI Core" (rare NFT drop).
* **Cloaking Field (Temporary):** 30 seconds of near-invisibility. Consumes "Phantom Cells," only found in Escape Pods.
* **Hardlight Tools:** Advanced construction/repair tools. Found in Orbital Station Debris.
* **Adaptive Camouflage (Unknown Tech):** Suit blends with environment. Found in Drone Swarm Hives.
* **Plasma Lance (Unknown Tech):** Devastating melee/short-range weapon. Requires Interceptor Shard components.

### Cybernetic Augmentation System

*Inspired by Alita: Battle Angel.* Players can enhance their own bodies with scavenged tech, blurring the line between human and machine.

#### Exoskeletal Frames

Full-body rigs worn over (or integrated into) the player. Only one Frame can be equipped at a time.

| Frame Type | Source | Ability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terran "Ironback" Rig** | Battleship Sections | +50% Carry Capacity, +25% Melee Damage. Heavy, loud. |
| **Terran "Sprinter" Harness** | Fighter Cockpits | +75% Movement Speed, Double Jump. Fragile armor. |
| **Unknown "Phantom" Weave** | Drone Swarm Hives | Near-silent movement, wall-cling, short glide. Requires Living Metal upkeep. |
| **Unknown "Berserker" Core** | Carrier Hangars | Massive strength and regeneration, but drains health over time. High risk/reward. |

#### Modular Augments (Limbs & Organs)

Individual body parts can be replaced or enhanced. Stacking augments creates unique builds.

| Augment Slot | Example Augment | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Optics (Eyes)** | "Thermal Lens Array" | See heat signatures through walls. Found in Interceptor Shards. |
| **Arms** | "Hydraulic Crushers" | Rip open locked doors/containers instantly. Found in Battleship Sections. |
| **Legs** | "Repulsor Anchors" | Immunity to knockback, stable aiming while moving. Found in Bomber Fuselages. |
| **Spine** | "Neural Accelerator" | Slow-motion perception for 3 seconds (bullet-time). Rare, requires AI Core. |
| **Heart** | "Fusion Pump" | Faster stamina regen, but vulnerable to EMP attacks. Found in Corvettes. |

*Augments require periodic maintenance (token cost) or they degrade and malfunction.*

#### AI Companions ("Ghosts")

Players can recover dormant AI personalities from wrecked ship computers. Once "awakened" in the Vault, these Ghosts provide passive bonuses and can be "slotted" into gear.

| Ghost Type | Personality | Passive Bonus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Navigator" (Terran)** | Calm, analytical. | Reveals nearby loot on the map. |
| **"Warden" (Terran)** | Protective, alert. | Warns of nearby enemies/players. Auto-marks threats. |
| **"Whisper" (Unknown)** | Cryptic, unsettling. | Occasionally reveals hidden paths or secret caches. |
| **"Fury" (Unknown)** | Aggressive, volatile. | +15% Damage dealt, but -10% accuracy. |

*Ghosts are rare NFTs. They can be traded, sold, or permanently "bonded" to a weapon for unique effects.*

## 3. Visual Identity & Atmosphere

* **Theme:** **"Atompunk Apocalypse"** / **"Vault-Dweller Chic"**.
* **Inspirations:** *Fallout* (game series & TV show), *NieR: Automata*, *Horizon Zero Dawn*.
* **Visual Pillars:**
  * **Retro-Futurism:** 1950s-60s Americana meets advanced technology. Chunky CRT monitors, vacuum tubes, rotary dials—but controlling fusion reactors and androids.
  * **Overgrowth:** Nature reclaiming the old world. Rusted cars, cracked highways, trees bursting through diners and gas stations.
  * **The Vaults/Silos:** Underground bunkers are the "safe zones." Inside, the aesthetic is preserved—clean(ish), humming generators, flickering lights. A stark contrast to the chaos outside.
  * **Atmosphere:** Heavy fog, volumetric god-rays, dust particles. The Wasteland feels vast and lonely. Vaults feel cramped but secure.
  * **UI Design:** **Diegetic & Retro.** The main HUD is a "Pip-Boy" style wrist device. Menus look like old terminal screens with green/amber text. Inventory is displayed as a physical backpack the player opens.
* **Quality Standard:** "Triple-I" (Indie Premium). The "retro" style allows us to use simpler geometry and flat textures intentionally, making the game run smoothly on web/mobile while looking stylized, not cheap. Post-Processing (Bloom, Film Grain, Color Grading) sells the cinematic look.

### The Vault System (Gameplay & Staking Integration)

* **Discovery:** Players find abandoned Vaults scattered across the Wasteland. Each Vault is a unique instance.
* **Activation:** To "claim" a Vault, the player must "Power it Up" by slotting (staking) a significant amount of ECHO-PRIME into the Vault Core.
* **Benefits:** An active Vault provides:
  * A safe respawn point.
  * Passive resource generation (Water, Power, Salvage).
  * Storage for gear that won't be lost on death.
  * A cosmetic "Home" to decorate and show off.
* **Risk:** If you fail to maintain the Vault (pay occasional upkeep fees), rival players can "Raid" it, potentially stealing a portion of your staked tokens.

---

## 3. The Dual-Token System

To protect the economy and allow for safe testing, we utilize two distinct tokens:

### 🪙 Token A: "ECHO-TEST" (The Beta Token)

* **Purpose:** For Beta Testing, balancing economy, and "Soft Launch" phases.
* **Value:** No real-world financial value strictly (or pegged to a very low stable value).
* **Utility:** Used to test bugs without risking the main liquidity pool.
* **Bridge:** Early adopters who earn "ECHO-TEST" will receive an airdrop of the Real Token based on their leaderboard position when we go live.

### 💎 Token B: "ECHO-PRIME" (The Production Token)

* **Purpose:** The real, tradable cryptocurrency on Solana.
* **Obtainable:** Only by "Extracting" high-tier loot from the Zone or buying on exchanges.
* **Utility:** Purchasing Licenses, Insuring Gear, Trading Artifacts.

---

## 4. Economic Loop & Value Accrual

### The "Buy-In" (Revenue Generator)

* **Cost:** ~$15 USD (paid in SOL/USDC).
* **Action:** The system automatically swaps this $15 for ECHO-PRIME on the open market (Constant Buy Pressure).
* **Reward:** Player receives an **"Operator License" (NFT)** and a Starter Kit.

### The "Staking" (Retention Mechanism)

* **Naming:** We do *not* call it "Staking." We call it **"Garrisoning"** or **"Powering Up."**
* **Mechanic:**
  * To activate a **Personal Base**, players must "Slot" (Stake) 500 ECHO-PRIME into the Base Core.
  * While slotted, these tokens are removed from circulation (Supply Shock).
  * The Base produces specific resources (Ammo, Water) passively while powered.
  * **Un-staking:** If a player wants their tokens back, they must "Power Down" (a 3-7 day cooldown process), preventing panic selling.

### The Faucet (Earning)

* **Artifacts:** Players find rare "Data Drives" or "Tech Fragments" in the Zone.
* **Extraction:** They must physically carry them to an exit.
* **Liquidation:** Selling these artifacts to "The Syndicate" (Game Treasury) rewards them with ECHO-PRIME.
  * *Dynamic Pricing:* The Syndicate lowers its buying price if the Treasury is running low, automatically balancing inflation.

### The Sink (Burning)

* **Maintenance:** "Nano-Repair" for suits costs tokens.
* **Insurance:** "Clone Insurance" preserves gear on death.
* **Trading Tax:** 5% fee on the Player-to-Player marketplace. 2.5% goes to Devs, 2.5% is Burned forever.

---

## 5. Technical Infrastructure (Lean & Premium)

* **Game Engine:** **React Three Fiber (Web)**.
  * *Pros:* Zero install for users. Instant updates. Runs on same stack as our sites.
  * *Graphics:* Uses `postprocessing` library for that "expensive" look.
* **Backend:** **Convex** (Database & Realtime Functions).
  * *Pros:* Handles thousands of concurrent item updates cheaply. Serverless.
  * *Logic:* Verifies all "Extractions" to prevent cheating.
* **Hosting:** Existing **VPS**. Node.js Game Server instances.
* **Blockchain:** **Solana**.
  * *Integration:* Wallet only needed for Login and Deposits/Withdrawals. Gameplay is "Gasless" (managed by our server key, batched).

---

## 6. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: The "Vertical Slice" (Prototype)

* **Objective:** Prove the "Look" and the "Basic Loop" (Walk -> Loot -> Extract).
* **Tech:** Next.js + R3F.
* **Map:** A single "Ruined Server Room" biome.
* **Economy:** ECHO-TEST token on Solana Devnet.

### Phase 2: The Beta (Soft Launch)

* **Objective:** Test 500 concurrent players on VPS. Balance the "Staking" rewards.
* **Feature:** Multiplayer interaction (seeing other players), Inventory System.

### Phase 3: The Main Landing (Production)

* **Objective:** Launch ECHO-PRIME token. Marketing push.
* **Feature:** Full map, PVP enabled, "Garrison" (Staking) system live.

  name: v.string(),
  type: v.union(v.literal("weapon"), v.literal("augment"), v.literal("frame"), v.literal("resource"), v.literal("blueprint")),
  rarity: v.union(v.literal("common"), v.literal("uncommon"), v.literal("rare"), v.literal("legendary")),
  origin: v.union(v.literal("terran"), v.literal("unknown")),
  stats: v.object({...}),
  imageUrl: v.string(),
}),
```

### 7.2 Vault (Staking) System

**On-Chain (Anchor Program - Rust):**

```rust
// programs/echo_vaults/src/lib.rs
#[account]
pub struct Vault {
    pub owner: Pubkey,
    pub staked_amount: u64,
    pub power_level: u8,
    pub last_claim_timestamp: i64,
    pub is_raidable: bool,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct PowerUpVault<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub vault: Account<'info, Vault>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player_token_account: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub vault_token_account: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

pub fn power_up(ctx: Context<PowerUpVault>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Transfer tokens from player to vault escrow
    // Update vault.staked_amount
    // Set vault.is_raidable = false for 7 days
}
```

### 7.3 Ghost (AI Companion) NFT System

**Metaplex NFT Metadata Structure:**

```json
{
  "name": "Navigator Ghost #0042",
  "symbol": "ECHO-GHOST",
  "description": "A calm, analytical AI recovered from a Terran Frigate.",
  "image": "https://arweave.net/.../navigator_ghost.png",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Origin", "value": "Terran" },
    { "trait_type": "Personality", "value": "Navigator" },
    { "trait_type": "Passive Bonus", "value": "Reveals nearby loot" },
    { "trait_type": "Bond Level", "value": 0 }
  ],
  "properties": {
    "category": "image",
    "files": [{ "uri": "...", "type": "image/png" }]
  }
}
```

**Game Integration (Convex):**

```typescript
ghosts: defineTable({
  mintAddress: v.string(), // Solana NFT mint address
  ownerId: v.id("players"),
  personality: v.union(v.literal("navigator"), v.literal("warden"), v.literal("whisper"), v.literal("fury")),
  bondLevel: v.number(), // 0-100, increases with use
  bondedWeaponId: v.optional(v.id("items")),
}),
```

### 7.4 Cybernetic Augmentation System

**Player Augment Slots (Convex):**

```typescript
augments: defineTable({
  playerId: v.id("players"),
  slot: v.union(v.literal("optics"), v.literal("arms"), v.literal("legs"), v.literal("spine"), v.literal("heart")),
  itemId: v.id("items"),
  durability: v.number(), // Degrades over time
  malfunctioning: v.boolean(),
}),
```

**Maintenance Loop (Convex Cron Job):**

```typescript
// convex/crons.ts
export const degradeAugments = cronJob({
  schedule: "0 * * * *", // Every hour
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // Find all augments with durability > 0
    // Reduce durability by 1
    // If durability hits 0, set malfunctioning = true
    // Player must pay tokens to repair
  },
});
```

### 7.5 Extraction & Loot Verification

**Server-Side Validation (Convex Mutation):**

```typescript
// convex/extraction.ts
export const extractLoot = mutation({
  args: { playerId: v.id("players"), lootItems: v.array(v.id("items")) },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const player = await ctx.db.get(args.playerId);
    
    // 1. Verify player is at an extraction point (check coordinates)
    // 2. Verify player is alive
    // 3. Verify items are in player's "held" inventory (not storage)
    // 4. Move items to player's permanent storage
    // 5. Update lastExtraction timestamp
    // 6. If high-value items, trigger on-chain mint (batched)
    
    return { success: true, extractedCount: args.lootItems.length };
  },
});
```

### 7.7 Token Economics Implementation

**Dynamic Syndicate Pricing (Convex):**

```typescript
// convex/syndicate.ts
export const getSyndicatePrice = query({
  args: { itemType: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const treasury = await ctx.db.query("treasury").first();
    const basePrice = ITEM_BASE_PRICES[args.itemType];
    
    // If treasury is low, reduce buy price
    // If treasury is high, increase buy price
    const modifier = Math.min(1.5, Math.max(0.3, treasury.balance / HEALTHY_TREASURY_AMOUNT));
    
    return basePrice * modifier;
  },
});
